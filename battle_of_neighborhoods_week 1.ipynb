    "This final project aims to explore Japanese restaurants located in the city of New York. New York city is home to thousands of different restaurants which are spread across its five boroughs. Japanese cuisine has seen a significant increase in popularity in the last few decades and this has in turn resulted in numerous Japanese restaurants populating New York city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Japanese cuisine has become extremely popular, a prospective business owner looking to open a new restaurant must carefully chose the best location to open their business. Factors such as local competition, demographics, population base etc. are very important in the decision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will compare Japanese restaurants in New York in order to establish the best places to find Japanese cuisine in the city. Also, the report will provide insights into the frequency and average rating of Japanese restaurants around New York city. This information can be used to determine where a new Japanese restaurant may have the greatest possibility of success in New York."
